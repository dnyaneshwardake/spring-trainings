Spring MVC Features: 
1. Form backup support
2. Controller Support
    - Controller (I) (Core Controller)
	- AbstractController (C) (Core Controller) (internally Implementing abstract Controller)
	
	- ParameterizedViewController
	- UrlFilenameViewController (Implemetation by Spring)
	- ViewController (Parent)

	- MultiactionController (Capable of handling multiple requests) (Deprecated by spring , Reason: Annotation config provided better approach)
		Working: 1. we have to give same method names in controller as action names coming from UI part 
				 2. Methods in controller must have same signature like handleRequestmentod();
		
	- BaseCommandController (Form backup support) : Deprecated - We ahve UI framework for for bakup support, and new annotations config.
		- AbstactFormConroller
		- AbstractCommandController

3. Validation Support
4. I18N Support
5. Interceptors Support
6. View Resolver (InternalResourceViewResolver)
7. Exception Handling  (Very Imp) (@ControllerAdvise, @ExceptionHandler)


1 Beanfactory -> Core Container 
  ApplicationContext

IN Spring MVC WebApplicationContext (Web Container)


--------------------------------------

Recommanded - JSP model Arct. , Common operation -> validation, authentication -> in one controller - JSP model 1 

If controller is servlet -> JSP model 2 -> Spring designed using model 2  - DispatcherServlet by Spring (Front controller)

If Fileters -> JSP model 3

Tomcat Container supports below URL pattern
 / -> all request
 /login - filetring with login string
 *.extention


Tomcat version 8.5 



========================================

Spring DAO (Data access objects)

1. JDBC (RDBMS)
1. ORM (Object relation mapping) [Java representation tables]
	a. EJB
	b. JPA
	c. Hibernate
	d. Ibatics

(Above all ORM are for RDBMS)

3. LDAP - LDAP machine


----------------------------

Spring JDBC (JDBC template)
	- Interface implemetation strategy.
		1. frameworks keeps changing in market.
		2. Have similar method signatures in DAO interfaces and Impl
	
	DAO Interface -> DAOImpl class
