Spring MVC Features: 
1. Form backup support
2. Controller Support
    - Controller (I) (Core Controller)
	- AbstractController (C) (Core Controller) (internally Implementing abstract Controller)
	
	- ParameterizedViewController
	- UrlFilenameViewController (Implemetation by Spring)
	- ViewController (Parent)

	- MultiactionController (Capable of handling multiple requests) (Deprecated by spring , Reason: Annotation config provided better approach)
		Working: 1. we have to give same method names in controller as action names coming from UI part 
				 2. Methods in controller must have same signature like handleRequestmentod();
